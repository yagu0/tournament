Email notifications 1h before tournament
(Also email notification when a new tournament is created?)
Debug utils/mwmatching3.js
The "Load more" button needs to be clicked twice (?!)
In Tournament.vue:
 - allow to cancel tournament (eg. if not enough players)
 - allow to go back and relaunch round if mistakes
 - Audio file isn't played at new round
 - select box to look back at previous rounds?
