Email notifications 1h before tournament
(Also email notification when a new tournament is created?)
Debug utils/mwmatching3.js
The "Load more" button needs to be clicked twice (?!)
In Tournament.vue:
 - allow to cancel tournament (eg. if not enough players)
 - allow to go back and relaunch round if mistakes
 - Audio file isn't played at new round
 - select box to look back at previous rounds?

translate pairing to javascript
provide comma-separated list of variants for tournament => no more box below to edit between rounds (or maybe still... but pre-filled)
   (also provide bothcol, cadence, etc)
=> new table "Rounds" maybe, pre-filled with rounds infos. Warning: deletion of end earlier.
Ne pas fixer à l'avance le nombre de rondes ?
