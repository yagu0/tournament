## Basic tool to manage chess tournaments

Pairing algorithm is based on the weighted maximum matching code found here https://github.com/mlbright/Assignment-Problem/blob/master/mwmatching.py

Current process is still a bit too long to be used in big tournaments. See first lines of pairing.R

Next step: web interface where players would enter result + game link, with a "launch next round" button.
